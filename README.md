A WebApp for Antibody Research 

- Fabulous: main code serving the WebApp
- AbSolute: our core python engine in charge of all your antibody calculations
- developAble: a multi-modal platform to handle trained AI models and apply their predictions to your antibody 
- ... more to come!

## Fabulous
**Fabulous** is a React + Vite web App hosting all the beautiful designs together. It makes the whole application available online and communicate with the API AbSolute through an Axios component

## AbSolute
